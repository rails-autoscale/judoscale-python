# judoscale-python

This is the official Python adapter for [Judoscale](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/judoscale). You can use Judoscale without it, but this gives you request queue time metrics and job queue time (for supported job processors).

## Installation

```
pip install judoscale-python
```

## Supported web frameworks

- [x] Django
- [ ] Flask
- [ ] FastAPI

## Supported job processors

- [ ] Celery
- [ ] RQ

## Using Judoscale with Django

Add Judoscale app to `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "judoscale.django",
    # ... other apps
]
```

Customize Judoscale options in `settings.py` (optional):

```python
JUDOSCALE = {
    # LOG_LEVEL defaults to ENV["LOG_LEVEL"] or "INFO".
    "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG",

    # API_BASE_URL defaults to ENV["JUDOSCALE_URL"], which is set for you when you install Judoscale.
    # This is only exposed for testing purposes.
    "API_BASE_URL": "https://example.com",

    # REPORT_INTERVAL_SECONDS defaults to 10 seconds.
    "REPORT_INTERVAL_SECONDS": 5,
}
```

Once deployed, you will see your request queue time metrics available in the Judoscale UI.
